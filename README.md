   The Brainfuck Language 

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language noted for its extreme minimalism. It is a Turing tarpit, designed to challenge and amuse programmers, and was not made to be suitable for practical use. It was created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller.


BrainFuckDotNet, the .NET brainfuck compiler

The brainfuck compiler creates a .NET executable assembly from brainfuck source code. This assembly can then be run using the Microsoft .NET Framework, or the Mono Runtime. 
The brainfuck compiler is written in C#. It can be compiled and used under Microsoft Windows or GNU/Linux: A Microsoft Visual Studio 8 solution file is included in the source archive.
To compile a binary, run: [mono] bfc.exe filename.bf [-o filename.exe]. Omitting the output filename will produce a program named "a.exe".
Some exceptions are sent if your code is invalid, if you don't have write access to the output binary for example. Please feel free to submit a patch if you find a bug.
